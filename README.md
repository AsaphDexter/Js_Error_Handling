# Js_Error_Handling
Similar to other languages like Java or C#, JavaScript has an error-handling mechanism that uses a try-catch-finally block to catch runtime issues. try: in the try block, wrap questionable code that could cause an error. When an error happens, write code in the catch block to do anything.
